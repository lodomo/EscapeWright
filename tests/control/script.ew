# Before they enter the room

Hey guys, you must be Lisa's group. OR Hey you guys must be here to test out the new arcade game. Lisa was supposed to be here for that. So, Katana Co. told us that you needed to sign a waiver. That’s this thing on the door, they said that you would know how to use it. She is somewhere in here, but don’t worry, feel free to use the restroom, “sign” the waiver, and lock up your items. She should be out in a few.

So Lisa isn’t back yet, but I can get you started. Here is a coin for Code Samurai and you all know how to use a floppy right? Well just in case you didn’t know the part with the metal circle is the bottom. If you need to insert it make sure that, that is the bottom. And if you need to take it out there will be a button for you to press.

(Press the fog button towards the end of the rules video)

Don’t use excessive force.

Don’t pull on any wires.

You won’t need to reach above the height of the door frame.
Don’t forget to close the door when you enter.

# Story Script

**(After ‘Get over here” and music starts)**

Welcome to Neo Tokyo, I am Ronin. I shall crush you just like I crushed Lisa.

**(When they input the door code before completing the lights)**

Nice try, But I can still see you.

You’ll have to shoot my eyes out before you try to get in here

**(When they enter the lair)**

You’re smarter than you look, but you’ll never be able to get this neon katana.

Looks like you’ve made it into my lair, you’ll never be able to kill me. My beautiful heart is safe.

**(When they get the katana)**

No! Don’t take that neon katana and stab my heart! That would be a bad idea. You should do anything else, but that.

What!? Impossible! Get that away from my heart! Don’t stab my heart!

Make sure you press down on that button, if you're going to kill me at least do it right.

No! Don’t stab me. I have a baby AI. They need me!

Bleh! Dying sounds! Cough, cough. Dead. Don’t forget to close the door behind you.

**(Other things to say)**

Only one floppy disk remaining, you’ll never get it.

I am only helping you because I’m bored.

I’m only helping because you seem like you need it.

You might have a case of the butter fingers someone else should try.
