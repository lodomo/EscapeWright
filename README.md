# Escape Wright

## Description

Escape Wright is a way to create escape rooms quickly, and have an entire network
of raspberry pis available at your finger tips. Setting up each raspberry pi 
is not a trivial task, but this makes it much easier. Originally planned
as a Python Library, Escape Wright is more of a framework for putting files
where they need to go, and preparing all the services needed to run each pi.

## Installation

It's easiest to let the installer do the work for you, download a little too much
and then clean up the junk you don't need.
